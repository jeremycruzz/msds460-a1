Write a python script that calculates that minimum cost of food given these constraints:

Sodium

Maximum

5,000 milligrams (mg)

Energy

Minimum

2,000 Calories (kilocalories, kcal)

Protein

Minimum

50 grams (g)

Vitamin D

Minimum

20 micrograms (mcg)

Calcium

Minimum

1,300 milligrams (mg)

Iron

Minimum

18 milligrams (mg)

Potassium

Minimum

4,700 milligrams (mg)

here is the data to use

|Variable | Item            | Price | Sodium | Energy | Protein | Vitamin D | Calcium | Iron | Potassium |
|---------|-----------------|-------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|---------|------|-----------|
|x1       | Chicken + Rice  |$2.838 |225mg   |810cal  |72g      |0.3mcg     |39mg     |1.2mg |1335mg     |

To solve this problem, we'll frame it as a linear programming (LP) problem, aiming to minimize the total cost of the food items while satisfying the nutritional constraints. We'll use the `PuLP` library in Python, which allows us to define and solve LP problems.

The steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1. Define the decision variables, which in this case are the quantities of each food item to be purchased.
2. Define the objective function, which is to minimize the total cost of these items.
3. Define the constraints based on the nutritional requirements given.
4. Solve the LP problem.
5. Output the optimal quantities of each food item and the minimum cost.

First, ensure you have the `PuLP` library installed. If it's not installed, you can install it via pip (`!pip install pulp`).

Now, let's write the script to solve the problem:

```python
import pulp

# Step 1: Define the problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Minimize_Cost_of_Food", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Step 2: Define decision variables
x1 = pulp.LpVariable("Chicken_Rice", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
x2 = pulp.LpVariable("Eggs", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
x3 = pulp.LpVariable("Chicken_Pot_Pie", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
x4 = pulp.LpVariable("Snickers", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')
x5 = pulp.LpVariable("Waffles", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')

# Step 3: Define objective function
problem += 2.838 * x1 + 0.292 * x2 + 2.046 * x3 + 0.150 * x4 + 0.386 * x5, "Total Cost"

# Step 4: Define constraints
# Sodium (max 5000mg)
problem += 225 * x1 + 70 * x2 + 950 * x3 + 40 * x4 + 410 * x5 <= 5000, "MaxSodium"
# Energy (min 2000kcal)
problem += 810 * x1 + 70 * x2 + 610 * x3 + 80 * x4 + 195 * x5 >= 2000, "MinEnergy"
# Protein (min 50g)
problem += 72 * x1 + 6 * x2 + 17 * x3 + 1 * x4 + 4.6 * x5 >= 50, "MinProtein"
# Vitamin D (min 20mcg)
problem += 0.3 * x1 + 4 * x2 + 0 * x3 + 0 * x4 + 0 * x5 >= 20, "MinVitaminD"
# Calcium (min 1300mg)
problem += 39 * x1 + 30 * x2 + 30 * x3 + 0 * x4 + 260 * x5 >= 1300, "MinCalcium"
# Iron (min 18mg)
problem += 1.2 * x1 + 0.9 * x2 + 4.8 * x3 + 0 * x4 + 3.6 * x5 >= 18, "MinIron"
# Potassium (min 4700mg)
problem += 1335 * x1 + 70 * x2 + 270 * x3 + 0 * x4 + 50 * x5 >= 4700, "MinPotassium"

# Step 5: Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Step 6: Print the results
if pulp.LpStatus[problem.status] == "Optimal":
    print("Optimal solution found!")
    print(f"Quantities to purchase for minimizing cost:")
    for variable in problem.variables():
        print(f"{variable.name}: {variable.varValue}")
    print(f"Minimum cost: ${problem.objective.value()}")
else:
    print("No optimal solution found.")
```

This script sets up the problem with all the constraints and solves for the minimum cost solution that meets all the nutritional requirements. After running it, you will get the quantities of each food item you should purchase to minimize cost while satisfying all the nutritional constraints.
