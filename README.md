##### Chicken

###### Price Calculation
$\$3.50/lb = \$3.50/16oz$
$\$0.875/4oz$

##### Rice

###### Price Calculation
**NOTE:** I have a 20lb bag of rice so there was a bit of a conversion for price compared to the costco one.

Let x be the price of the 20lb bag
$25/16.02 = 20/x$
$25x = 320.40$
$x = 12.816$

Calculate price per serving
$\$12.816/180=.071$


#### Egg
